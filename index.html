<h2>Welcome to the Xatunes Blog!</h2>

<p>Welcome! This is my blog for the game Friday Night Funkin! I was told it would be fun to work on a mod on it,<br>
and I really liked both the Lullaby Mod and the D-Sides mod. So I'm working on this now! D-sides Lullaby!<br>
I will update with any progress later! Bye!!!</p>

<p>Working on: Saftey Lullaby D-Sides!!<p>
